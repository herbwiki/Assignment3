    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The Herb Gardenz project is a community-based herb garden website and app that allows people to find, pin and share locations of herb gardens and herbs. The website allows users to upload photos of herbs and locations for others to see as well as commenting on locations. This allows for the community aspect of the service to thrive as the service relies on users for its functionalities. Motivation for this project was that we wanted to create a service that was community based as well as informative and hopefully will allow people to save time and money using the website. Hopefully, an outcome of using the app is a strengthened community and with recent events we believe that an app like Herb Gardenz a promising idea. The app also features a list of herbs with information about each for if a user wants to look at expanding their knowledge or wanting to try something new, the information includes things such as flavor profiles and recopies that use the herb.  </p>
    <p>A goal for this project is to further community-based ideas in applications and promote the use of community features. The Herb Gardenz website relies on having an active community and such promoting this will help the site. The site will have a map and GPS feature that allows users to see where they are in relation to herbs that have been imputed by other users. They are also able to click and see the information of the herb from the pin on a location. We plan to use the Google API for the map and GPS features. </p>
    <p>Our motivations for this project are to create an app using community-based features and demonstrate our knowledge of IT systems. The purpose of the website is to help other save money, live more sustainably and promote a healthier lifestyle using community gardens to help with their cooking. The site will use the Google API for the map services and to implement this we will use Java. Java is a skill that is sought after by some employers with this programming language being popular with many websites, mobile apps, GUI applications and more. Skills in HTML and CSS are also shown with the website and shows knowledge of design and more with an employer. This app follows the trend of using app services with many applications using a GPS and map features.  </p>
    <p>While there are many gardening services and apps to help with cooking, our website aims to have the users search for community gardens and other places to find herbs and we are trying to have our website be informative and community based unlike many competitors. There are many competitors that an “pin” locations for others to see but I have not been able to find a service that focuses on our topic and purpose, similar apps are for joke services or things that cannot be found via google maps, and that is a similar goal that we share and unlike our competitors, we allow users to review and test different locations imputed by another user, with possibly the ability to have fake locations or old locations removed  </p>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Aims</button>
    <div class="collapsiblecontent">
      <p>Due to the technical complexity of our project along with the extremely specific targets that we have laid out from the very beginning there are a few goals that we need to achieve to create a functional and viable application that is useable. </p>
      <p>One of the first important goals is to learn how to create the main function of the application which is, a custom interactive map using either Google maps API or OpenStreetMap that can take inputs and display them on a map. This is probably the most important goal on this list, as without it the main function and idea of connecting people with data is lost. Without the map function it would just be a list, this means that technically people can find herbs in their area with just an address but with no way to visualize it, it severely detracts from the usability of our website as users cannot visually see where these specific herbs are. This usually is not a huge issue for a lot of applications but due to herb gardens usually not sitting at an actual address and just being next to the sidewalk or down an alleyway, an address is not very useful.  </p>
      <p>The aim of this goal is to create an application/website that can take user input about a herb and its location and display it on a map for everyone user to see so that they can use/know about herb gardens in their area.  </p>
      <p>Another goal that we found necessary was to find a way to design the application to be extremely user friendly and fit our wholesome aesthetic. This was done by researching similar applications and understanding basic user centered design regarding contrast and colour. This goal is necessary to us because without a friendly looking design and colour pallet, users might be turned away from even using our application; and since our entire application is built on user Input that would be a problem. </p>
      <p>The main aim of this goal is to create a friendly and inviting application to support users that come to our application. Although this aim is quite broad, we found it required a lot of research regarding colour theory and other design principles to help continue our goal in achieving this aim. Overall, there are many goals for us to achieve to provide a decent user experience for all of our users, and these goals were found out through design and communication.  </p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Plans and progress</button>
    <div class="collapsiblecontent">
      <p>
        Our project idea is to create an application that gives people in a community access to various herbs and plants and gives them the location for them to use themselves. The idea originated from one of our team members, Hamish, and we decided to follow it as we also believed that it would be an interesting and useful idea to follow. We decided to create this website as we also believed that the website would allow for greater connection of the community as the website literally gives locations of herbs that people can use for themselves. The reason for a greater sense of community is that the locations are shared by the people themselves that live in the area, giving others the chance to share in the benefits of these plants.
      </p>
      <p>From there our website “HerbGardenz” was created. </p>
      <p>
        Our website name, “HerbGardenz”, is designed to differentiate us from other websites and affiliations. As we searched for a name that we could use, we made sure to have our own product be distinct from others. Through this name we hope to show our own originality that we poured into our product. To create the website, we decided on using html and CSS, to add styling and the backbone of the website. We then followed up with using JavaScript, as some of our members have experience in this language and this is what is used to implement the maps feature into the website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Starting from the beginning we were happy with this idea, so we did not feel much reason to change it. We did not change the foundation of this product and instead built upon it, adding our originality and creativity into the project.
        Over the course of A2 and A3, we all had some idea of how we wanted the website to look. To all share our thoughts, we created a prototype of the design on Figma, a prototyping tool, which housed the ideas we wanted to implement and the features. We used this prototype as a foundation for the layout and look of our website, helping to give us direction in the project we were creating.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are currently in the design and prototype phase of our project. We are creating a foundational product with which we can continuously grow and then reach the testing phase. In the testing phase we will share the product asking for feedback and opinions from potential users. After the testing phase is finished, we will continue onto the next phase of applying the feedback and adding it to our product. After all testing is finished, we will then reach the final phase in which we release the website.
      </p>
      <p> Our logo for the website would be an image of the planet and a plant growing from it. We believe that this logo is best as it demonstrates our idea. The plant symbolises the ease with which plants can grow anywhere across the world and thus shows reachability and access. The world symbolises the various communities that share and grow these plants for everyone to use. It symbolises outreach across the world. Stemming from the logo, we decided on simple aesthetics and simple colours. This helps the website in terms of functionality as it becomes easy to use for all people and easy to look at. We decided on using colours that reflect the Earth, such as: White for clouds, Blue for sky, Green for plants.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the project there are simple yet integral features which the website must have. The key features of our product include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>An index system to house and share data about specific plants that are sought after. This library shares a basic description of the plants, an image for reference and situations in which the plants can be used. The information about the plants will be gathered from a collective information website such as Wikipedia and other scholarly articles which will be used to give a brief description. The index will be on a separate page than the maps page. A search function built into the index to easily find the plant or herb that the user requires. </li>
        <li>A map feature in which people can input their location, the name of the plant and a category based on the website filters. After the user inputs the location, anyone on the website would be able to view the plants and the location that its in. They would then be able to go and pick it up. The map feature is implemented using JavaScript, which uses “OpenLayers” and the open-source community map “OpenStreetMap”.</li>
        <li>We will have a feature for users to provide feedback and information on the website so that we can further update and improve in the future. This will be used for people to voice their concerns and share their opinions.</li>
      <p>To save our data, we plan to use a database which would store both the images of the herbs we have in the index/library and the information stored for these herbs. The choice for this would be MongoDB as it is best for storing the images we need and data that we need. Since it is a NoSQL database, we will need to learn more about how to manage and create this database.
      </p>
      <p>As of now, our map uses coordinates to choose an area to add a herb. In a future version, we plan to change the input into adding a location address which will make it easier to input the locations of plants. We will also add an input function of typing the location instead of clicking on the map.
      </p>
      <p>For hosting the website, right now we are hosting on a free platform which provides ease of access and connection to our github repository. Later in the future, we will decide to switch to AWS to host the website. This hosting will be done after the prototype phase, so that we can have a working product for the testing phase to commence.
      </p>
      <p>As this is a small project, for advertising we decided that using various methods such as social media and other platforms to begin sharing the product online for people to use. This method would assist us in easily sharing the product for people to use. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Roles</button>
    <div class="collapsiblecontent">
      <p>Because of how we delegated our work and learnt from the previous assignments we found our individual skills and delegated accordingly, this meant that figuring out roles for most team members was quite easy.  </p>
      <h5>Yusuf: Project Manager</h5>
      <p>The reason for Yusuf's role as project manager was very easy to determine. As soon as each assignment started, Yusuf was always the first one to create documents/repositories and start assigning work. This meant that the idea of Yusuf as a project manager is not very far-fetched. </p>
      <h5>Shivam: Lead Developer</h5>
      <p>Shivam’s drive to learn new and complimented technologies to achieve our goals instantly made us decide to have them as our lead developer. This was due to their impressive expertise in multiple technologies and their willingness to delegate to the Support developer high content so that they could focus on technically difficult tasks that made them an easy pick for a Lead Developer  </p>
      <h5>Jet: Technical Writer</h5>
      <p>Jets' proficiency in writing about technical aspects in this project report, as well as their great results from their research into a technology from the last assignment earned them the role of Technical Writer </p>
      <h5>Aaron: Support Technical Writer</h5>
      <p>Aaron's ability to write a large amount of good work quickly gives incredible support to all members of the team  </p>
      <h5>Nicholas: Interface Designer</h5>
      <p>Nick’s ability to design an extremely pleasing interface that fits our aesthetic is integral for the actual creation of our application, and their skill in doing so earned them Interface Designer </p>
      <h5>Hamish: Support Developer</h5>
      <p>Hamish’s ability to support and keep up with Shivam and help out when the more content heavy stuff arises gains Support Developer. </p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Scope and limits</button>
    <div class="collapsiblecontent">
      <p>As is said throughout every project, a scope never really ends; the largest of projects are never fully completed. Although our application does have a very clear “end” you may call it, regarding a collaborative space where people can share and view herb locations. Even through the development of our application ideas always appear and the want to provide more is always there, to not push our luck and create something feasible by the end of this assignment was extremely important. This feasible outcome was determined through group discussion on Teams meetings that we had; This resulted in the following outcome:  </p>
      <ul>
        <li>    A prototype workable display of Open Street Maps without input. This workable prototype is feasible given the time that we have. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The reason for not having the input of this is because we are not delivering into a user-based environment and an input creation is time that we do not have. If this assignment was deliverable to be useable to a user this would be a different story and we would likely focus on a list with input instead of the map.  </p>
      <p>Another scope limitation that we implemented was not having any hosted webpage for the application, since this is to just show a small number of people an idea; paying and hosting a website would be a waste of time and money. Although if we continued with this project and made a deliverable product this would be necessary. </p>
      <p>Along with scope limitations comes extra features that we would want to implement in the future such as:  </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A database for herbs with their descriptions, images and use-cases</li>
        <li>A forum in-built into the website to communicate about certain herbs and their locations.</li>
        <li>A search function to find the herbs required</li>
        <li>An Input for both the herb location and a type of herb</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Tools and technology</button>
    <div class="collapsiblecontent">
      <p>A platform’s tool and technology stack can be divided into three sections: Hardware, Firmware, and Software. Hardware to decide how the application will be hosted, Firmware to power the hardware and to run the Software application that’ll be pushed to users. </p>
      <p>Server:</p>
      <p>We initially hosted the platform on an old laptop (HP Pavillion x360) that was repurposed into a home server as the Lead Developer, Shivam, had experience in self-hosting. However, this quickly changed after realizing the issue of future maintenance, reliability, and scaling issues. To resolve this, we switched to using the Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution Heroku. Heroku allows us to automatically deploy the latest version of our application as it is synced with our organization Git repository. We can migrate this deployment to Amazon Web Services in the future as our userbase scales.   </p>
      <p>Firmware: As Heroku is a PaaS, we lost control over what backend firmware the server operates on, in future deployments on AWS, we plan on using an EC2 instance running Debian 11.3 (Linux). Both Hamish and Shivam have previous experience with using Linux operating systems and would be suitable for maintaining this possible deployment. </p>
      <p>Application:</p>
      <p>HerbGardenz is a web platform that aims to be accessible for browsers across the desktop and mobile market with the aim of providing a simple community contributed database of herbs all over the world. </p>
      <p>As a web platform, we have used the latest stable technologies seen in the industry such as Node.JS 18.2 to serve as our platform’s JavaScript runtime environment and use OpenLayer 6.14 to create an interactive map component to display API data from the open-source community map ‘OpenStreetMap.’ These technologies are wrapped in a frontend powered by basic HTML5, CSS3 and the CSS framework Tailwind CSS v3. Extra UI component customization is powered through daisyUI v2.15.1. NodeJS and the accompanying used libraries are new technologies that all team members have no experience in. As the platform scales, it is planned to “containerize” the application through Docker 20.10, this makes it easy to deploy and facilitates the transfer between Heroku to AWS. The application uses features implemented in versions released in the past, however, by using the latest stable versions, we can ensure that our platform has the latest security updates and bug fixes.  </p>
      <p>Our production runtime is deployed through Vite 2.9.9, a standard in node software stacks.  </p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Testing</button>
    <div class="collapsiblecontent">
      <p>For the testing stage of The Herb Gardenz project, we would have to conduct User Testing to get a firm idea, as well as feedback on what areas of our project need improvement, as well as a deeper understanding of what aspects of our project can be changed and manipulated in order to create it a user-friendly experience for the users. To conduct this user test, we would need to acquire voluntary participation from a community fairly interested in herbs, or a community who would find this project useful. This could be advertised online or as a poster to reach a vast number of the interested community. The preferred number of testers would usually be around 15-20+. The more testers we have, the more feedback we have on how to better improve our project. As a result, we would need to collate and summarize our data as qualitative feedback, rather than quantitative feedback, as this would be far more valuable in the improvement and implementation of the feedback into the project. But before we user test this project; we would first need to test it ourselves to develop an idea of all the bugs and errors that are contained within the project/program.

    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Risks</button>
    <div class="collapsiblecontent">
      <p>Risks that the Herb Gardenz project face are mainly based within the software that we are using and the programming language JavaScript. While collectively we have knowledge on what JavaScript is capable of, we do not have much experience in the language and will likely be learning much of the software as we develop. Another risk that comes from this issue is that we don’t know what is and is not realistically possible with the time and software and our goals may not be met during our allocated time. Thankfully JavaScript is well documented, and it is likely that any technical hurdles we may come across are likely to be resolved by searching online. Another hurdle is learning and using the Google API/OpenStreetMaps for the map features and implementing it into our website using JavaScript. GitHub has limitations regarding our project and our prototype may not be able to properly host the Google API, this is a risk as using this feature is required for our project goal and thus using GitHub may not be possible when developing the prototype and we may need to learn and use another site hosting service.

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Group processes and communications</button>
    <div class="collapsiblecontent">
      <p>This group was formed near the start of the semester (week 4 or 5) and as a result of this, moving into week 13, we have all spent much of this semester working together on assignments 2 and 3. This has helped us understand each other, and how we work together. We as a group have had meetings two times a week and have conducted all our communication and meetings on Microsoft Teams. Sometimes when we are all on site, we collaborate face-to-face, but when some of us are unable to attend the onsite tutorial, we just catch up via Teams. We have also set out work for each member of the group to either complete individually or as a pair to further spread out the workload evenly. We have had no incidents of team members not communicating or doing their part, because as mentioned earlier, their work is set out for them, and they know what needs to be done. If a member is having trouble with their tasks or needs further help, we always let the group know and we always try our best to help each other out. When we finish our tasks and try to offer a helping hand to our other team members if they need assistance to ensure that all the tasks are completed.
