    <h2>Group relfection</h2>
    <h4>Aaron</h4>
      <p>Throughout this semester, we have learnt a lot about each other, our strengths and weaknesses when it comes to group work. The most important aspect of group work is communication and contribution, I feel like my group has accomplished the contribution aspect. We have done this by assigning work to each group member equally to ensure that everyone contributes the same amount to the group project. I strongly believe that each member of this group is very talented when it comes to the work, but an area that could be improved as a group would be overall communication. Over the course of this semester, we have always started our assignment late, or later than usual. We also rarely had any team meetings, but as we grew closer to the deadlines of the assignment, we all contributed a 110% effort and any team meetings we did have was to ensure that everyone was on track, and to communicate any concerns or to ask for help. Another positive remark of this group is that everyone is so friendly and understanding, and always willing to help one another. We are always motivated after a team meeting; this is mainly because of the atmosphere that each member of the group brings to the discussion. Over the course of this semester, I have truly understood what teamwork consists of, and what makes a good team function at full capacity, and in my opinion, that would be communication and contribution. </p>
    <h4>Shivam</h4>
      <p>I think that throughout the time our group has worked together, our output has been exceptional and that we’ve really gotten to understand how we all work and function in a team. We’ve learnt how to divide roles equally and fairly, started consistently checking up on each other on assignment progress to see if someone needs help or to brainstorm ideas, and creative positive relationships with each other. One of our biggest downfalls, however, is the lack of communication and progress at the beginning of each milestone. During tutorial briefs, we set out the structure of our work document and still failed to communicate with each other and start the assignment. This is always made up though through the incredible work output shown in the final stretch of the assignment where our team has communicated effectively and collaborate on sections to a high standard, but the fact is that we could have so much more room to work with if we start communicating earlier in the assignment timeline. I was surprised by how effective team meetings were in creating group morale and helping us bond further, I used to feel scared by meetings as I thought that others would not be interested and look down on me for the work I’ve done. I have instead discovered through our team’s biweekly Microsoft Teams meetings that meetings let teams get to the core of any issues that might be happening and help establish a common motive to complete the assignment in the most optimal way, while also allocating time for members to interact and bond with each other where they might not normally have the time to do so.  </p>
      <p>One thing I have learnt from working in a group is that working to your own full potential inspires others to work hard as well and by putting in your best effort, you get put in a loop where everyone inspires each other and creates something of substantial quality.  </p>
    <h4>Hamish</h4>
      <p>Throughout this whole semester I have really noticed how lucky I am to be in a group that may not communicate perfectly but turns up and does the work. With the help of each group member, we have managed to realize the strengths and weaknesses of each team-member and putting each of those strengths to use. Regarding what could be improved, it would be initiative and communication; this is because a lot of us did not start until there was a sense of urgency throughout the whole semester and although communication was an issue it continually improved as we continued to the point that we really found nothing to talk about in some of the meetings. I was surprised by how similar a lot of each of the members are, we all have very similar interests and are looking forward to the same things; it creates a very easy communication (when we do communicate). I learnt that in groups it is extremely important for delegation and scheduling, the idea of “hey do this by this time” really works well for most people and creates an easy to manage group dynamic.  </p>
