    <h2>Group relfection</h2>
    <h4>Aaron</h4>
      <p>Throughout this semester, we have learnt a lot about each other, our strengths and weaknesses when it comes to group work. The most important aspect of group work is communication and contribution, I feel like my group has accomplished the contribution aspect. We have done this by assigning work to each group member equally to ensure that everyone contributes the same amount to the group project. I strongly believe that each member of this group is very talented when it comes to the work, but an area that could be improved as a group would be overall communication. Over the course of this semester, we have always started our assignment late, or later than usual. We also rarely had any team meetings, but as we grew closer to the deadlines of the assignment, we all contributed a 110% effort and any team meetings we did have was to ensure that everyone was on track, and to communicate any concerns or to ask for help. Another positive remark of this group is that everyone is so friendly and understanding, and always willing to help one another. We are always motivated after a team meeting; this is mainly because of the atmosphere that each member of the group brings to the discussion. Over the course of this semester, I have truly understood what teamwork consists of, and what makes a good team function at full capacity, and in my opinion, that would be communication and contribution. </p>
    <h4>Shivam</h4>
      <p>I think that throughout the time our group has worked together, our output has been exceptional and that we’ve really gotten to understand how we all work and function in a team. We’ve learnt how to divide roles equally and fairly, started consistently checking up on each other on assignment progress to see if someone needs help or to brainstorm ideas, and creative positive relationships with each other. One of our biggest downfalls, however, is the lack of communication and progress at the beginning of each milestone. During tutorial briefs, we set out the structure of our work document and still failed to communicate with each other and start the assignment. This is always made up though through the incredible work output shown in the final stretch of the assignment where our team has communicated effectively and collaborate on sections to a high standard, but the fact is that we could have so much more room to work with if we start communicating earlier in the assignment timeline. I was surprised by how effective team meetings were in creating group morale and helping us bond further, I used to feel scared by meetings as I thought that others would not be interested and look down on me for the work I’ve done. I have instead discovered through our team’s biweekly Microsoft Teams meetings that meetings let teams get to the core of any issues that might be happening and help establish a common motive to complete the assignment in the most optimal way, while also allocating time for members to interact and bond with each other where they might not normally have the time to do so.  </p>
      <p>One thing I have learnt from working in a group is that working to your own full potential inspires others to work hard as well and by putting in your best effort, you get put in a loop where everyone inspires each other and creates something of substantial quality.  </p>
    <h4>Hamish</h4>
      <p>Throughout this whole semester I have really noticed how lucky I am to be in a group that may not communicate perfectly but turns up and does the work. With the help of each group member, we have managed to realize the strengths and weaknesses of each team-member and putting each of those strengths to use. Regarding what could be improved, it would be initiative and communication; this is because a lot of us did not start until there was a sense of urgency throughout the whole semester and although communication was an issue it continually improved as we continued to the point that we really found nothing to talk about in some of the meetings. I was surprised by how similar a lot of each of the members are, we all have very similar interests and are looking forward to the same things; it creates a very easy communication (when we do communicate). I learnt that in groups it is extremely important for delegation and scheduling, the idea of “hey do this by this time” really works well for most people and creates an easy to manage group dynamic.  </p>
    <h4>Yusuf</h4>
      <p>Over the course of our working together one apparent issue with the group was communication. We were not adept and organisation and communication as a team but despite this we all worked well together. Each group member played to another’s strengths and each one helped another’s weaknesses. As a team we always offered help to another in whatever way we can. Obviously, communication is a vital skill in a team with which I believe we all could improve on, but despite this flaw, we all grew to understand each other and what we needed each other to do. Communication is a skill that cannot be mastered immediately. We as a group and as individuals over the course of our own futures, will develop this skill to improve our own work and to constantly improve. From our lack of organisation and communication, the surprising aspect of our team was that we work efficiently. This was evident in A2 and holds out to A3. We all still worked hard to finish our parts and offered to help the others with their parts. We realised the importance of teamwork as we can’t let one person fall, otherwise we all fall. We pushed each other to work hard and complete our parts. I learnt about the importance of scheduling and communication. Through this I learnt the ultimate need for team cohesion. When a part of a team, one must try to work well with their own respective team and try to get along. If one person is out of alignment with the team, the entire team gets put off balance. </p>
    <h4>Jet</h4>
      <p> Throughout both assignment 2 and assignment 3 I feel very lucky to be working with this group. The work that is assigned is always completed on time and everyone offers to go further than is expected to for the assignments. Despite this our group does struggle with communication and time management with this assignment starting quite late and suddenly that what would be more comfortable and favorable. Communication is important for any group project and is an important lesson that we all learn and a skill that we all develop moving forward. I also believe throughout this assignment that the group grew to understand how each other works and where able to support each other in this, but I think that we should try to match each skillset more when it comes to delectating work, this was done well previously but with this assignment the delegations was more rushed and a subject of the late start for our group. We did a good job of pushing everyone during this process to get the work done to a high standard, this was important because of the slow start that we had and to go along with this, everyone was very supportive of the work that had been done and we were all very optimistic on how we were travelling throughout.  </p>
    <h4>Nick</h4>
      <p>Since starting assignment 2 and finishing assignment 3, I have learned a lot about the people in this group. I feel like we all worked together very well and knew the strengths and weaknesses of each other early on, making it easy for tasks to be delegated across the group. Across both assignments, we collectively we were able to perform to a high standard and hit goals that we had set out along the way. Similarly, to assignment 2, communication was lacking at the beginning of assignment 3, although, we were able to quickly pull a few meetings together, decide on our game plan and knuckle down to achieve what we could, as best as we could. One thing that I have learned is that everyone works at their own pace, some people are much faster than others, yet as a group we did not let that affect us that much. Yes, it was a bit of a rush in the past week, but again, the work that we all put out was of a high standard and every one of us should be happy with what we have done. This group was great fun to work with, we definitely learned a lot from each other, whether that be Shivam being an absolute wiz with website programming or Jet and Hamish being able to write an ungodly amount of information in such a short time </p>
    <h4>Overall</h4>
    <p>As a group, we understand the importance of effective communication and realise its requirement in a working team dynamic. Although we fail to efficiently organise and follow communications, as a team we complete our tasks on time and make sure to support each other when necessary; whether that be through helping each other with work or even just asking for help. Another important positive that is highlighted is how the whole team together highlights the skills of each team members and how as a group implement that to achieve our goal in the most efficient and effective period.  Another aspect that is important to realize and is mainly highlighted by our group member Jet is how all team-members “push” each other to complete work, this is mainly because we are all quite comfortable around each other and when it seems like someone has forgotten something or if something needs to be done quickly a group member can comfortably either message that person or “at/@” them in the Teams post area, this creates an environment where everyone holds each other accountable to do the work on time. </p>
    <p>Over the span of the past assignments the group individually and overall has grown, especially in regards to getting better at our shortcomings. For example, our communication as a group was much worse for assignment 2 than it was for assignment 3; this was because we learnt easily from our mistakes and implemented fixes and improvements either to how we communicated with each other or how to plan and schedule our communication in a more effective manner. This is shown well with our “post” logs in Teams where we communicated most of our concerns and communication, in the previous assignment there was much less overall “text” communication whereas this assignment we found that it was extremely effective. Overall, our group did have shortcomings, but we managed to find decent ways to combat issues and, in the end, worked effectively to complete the tasks on time while supporting each other and learning a lot about the project that we imagined.</p>
